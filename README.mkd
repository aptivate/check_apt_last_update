# check_yum_last_update

This is a nagios plugin to check how long it has been since `apt-get upgrade` was last run. It should be installed on each server you want to check and accessed via NRPE.

Usage: check_apt_last_update [options]

Options:

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -w WARNING, --warning=WARNING
                          Issue WARNING if the last update was more than this
                          many days ago.
    -c CRITICAL, --critical=CRITICAL
                          Issue CRITICAL if the last update was more than this
                          many days ago.
    -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                          Sets a timeout in seconds after which the plugin will
                          exit (defaults to 30 seconds).
    -v, --verbose         Verbose mode. Can be used multiple times to increase
                          output. Use -vvv for debugging output. By default only
                          one result line is printed as per Nagios standards
    -V, --version         Print version number and exit

## NRPE set up

To configure it for NRPE you need a line like the below in your `nrpe.cfg`

    command[check_apt_last_update]=/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/lib/nagios/plugins/check_apt_last_update -w 45 -c 75

## How it works

It looks in `/var/log/apt/history.log` (or `history.log.1.gz` etc.) for the last line that starts with `Upgrade:` and then finds the following line that starts with `End-Date:`, parses the date on that line and then works out how long ago the update was.
